# Digital Value Backend Challenge

Welcome to the Digital Value Backend Challenge! Thank for your interest in participating in our selection process.

## Goal

The objective is to manipulate some data from an sqlite database and build an api to access it.

Each level of the challenge is based on top of the previous one, so you can leverage what you already did.

## Guidelines

- Clone the repo (do not fork it)
- Implement each level in ascending order (last level is optional)
- Commit at the end of each level
- Provide instructions to run each level of the challenge
- Optionally, host the last level of the challenge

## Rules

- Use version control to deliver the test
- You can use any libs

## What will be evaluated?

- Clean, readable and well-organized code
- Compliance with guidelines and rules
- Separation of concerns
- Logic used to write/build sql queries

Let's get started! Go to [First level](level1)
